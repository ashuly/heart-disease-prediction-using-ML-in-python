# heart-disease-prediction-using-ML-in-python
The project is developed using multiple python libraries such as TensorFlow with keras api, sklearn to demonstrate the working of neural networks and numpy pandas for data handling and preprocessing.
streamlit is also used to design the GUI of the model.
Various accuracy matrix are used to ensure the maximum preciseness of the predicted result.
the data used for training and tsting is also included in the repository with the trained model.
